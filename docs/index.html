    <h1>EMV Terminal Communication Project</h1>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal for this project is to implement a functional simulation of 
            an EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) terminal capable of initiating a 
            transaction with a standard chip-enabled payment card. 
            We want to cover the key stages of the EMV transaction flow, 
            including application selection, retrieving card data, processing 
            restrictions, and culminating in a transaction decision (approval, 
            decline, or referral online).

    <section id="system-description">
        <h2>System Description</h2>
        <p>
            Upon execution, the program first establishes communication with 
            a connected smart card reader using the PC/SC interface. It 
            initializes the necessary system resources, identifies an available 
            reader, and attempts to connect to an inserted smart card. 
            If successful, the core EMV transaction simulation begins. 
            This involves a sequence of command-response interactions with 
            the card, managed by the main EMV logic module. 
            The process starts by selecting the appropriate payment application 
            on the card. This is typically identified by its Application Identifier (AID). 
            The card's response provides initial configuration data, including a 
            list of data elements the terminal needs to supply (the Processing Data 
            Object List, or PDOL).
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the PDOL, the terminal constructs and sends a Get Processing 
            Options (GPO) command, providing necessary transaction context like 
            amount (set to zero in this simulation), date, and country code. 
            The card responds with processing information, including the 
            Application File Locator (AFL), which points to specific data files 
            stored on the card. The terminal then issues Read Record commands 
            based on the AFL to retrieve essential application data. Finally, 
            a Generate Application Cryptogram (GENERATE AC) command is sent, 
            requesting the card to perform cryptographic calculations and provide 
            a cryptogram that indicates the card's decision on the transaction 
            (such as approve offline, decline offline, or request online authorization). 
            The program parses this response, specifically looking for the 
            Cryptogram Information Data (CID), to determine and display this 
            initial outcome. After the transaction sequence concludes, the program 
            disconnects from the card and releases the smart card reader resources 
            before terminating.

    <!-- Development -->
    <section id="development">
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
            During initial development, we faced significant debugging challenges. 
            We experimented with various configuration settings, including pin 
            selection and pull-up resistors, and we tested different serial 
            communication protocols. Using an oscilloscope, we verified that 
            the I²C protocol was correctly sending the slave address followed by 
            a processing signal. However, the system encountered a persistent issue 
            where it continuously looped, repeatedly transmitting the same 
            slave address and APDU, hindering progress. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To overcome the communication issues, we transitioned to using an 
            Arduino board. This allowed us to successfully implement communication 
            with the NFC board using a reliable, pre-made I²C library. 
            At the time the demo was filmed, we no longer had access to the Arduino board. 
            Hence, we used a Sony Felicia NFC reader which works in a similar way.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            We used Mastercard and Visa NFC cards equipped with EMV chips to test 
            our functionality. Our test showed that the system failed to 
            initiate a connection when no card was present. However, placing a card 
            on the reader triggered a successful transaction flow that conformed to EMV standards.
